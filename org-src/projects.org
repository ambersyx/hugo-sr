** Summary

This is a short exploration into the tidy tuesday dataset focused on the Federal R&D budget towards global climate change. The data has been extracted from a TidyTuesday dataset, which in return is moderately cleaned dataset from publicly available data. The analysis will show that NASA's budget dwarfs the money going into other departments, and that the median spend towards climate change has been increasing since the year 2000.

We have 6 departments, and the remaining departments are lumped together as 'All Other'.

The data is available for the years 2000 to 2017.

The above can be found using the =unique= function.

#+BEGIN_SRC R  :results verbatim
climate_spend_raw$department %>% unique()
climate_spend_raw$year %>% unique()
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [1] "NASA"            "NSF"             "Commerce (NOAA)" "Energy"

: [16] 2015 2016 2017

Some Notes on the data:
- We have the following columns:
  - name of the department. (chr)
  - year (int)
  - spending (double)
- The data is relatively clean. However some manipulation is required to summarise the department wise spending.

An overview of missing data can be easily scrutinised using the =plot_intro= command, and actual numbers can be extracted using =introduce=. These functions are from the =DataExplorer= package.

#+BEGIN_SRC R  :results graphics file :file ./plot-intro.png :res 100 :width 800 :height 500
##plot_str(climate_spend_raw, type = 'r')
plot_intro(climate_spend_raw)
##introduce(climate_spend_raw)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:./plot-intro.png]]

There are no missing values or NA's.

For a quick look at the outliers, we can use a boxplot, using DataExplorer's functions.


#+BEGIN_SRC R :results graphics file :file ./variance-spend.png :res 100 :width 800 :height 500
variance_climate_spend <- plot_boxplot(climate_spend_raw, by = "year")

It is clear from here that the outlier department is NASA. Further exploration would be needed to understand the function of each department and the justification of this expenditure and the skew. /For example, one might think the Interior department would not be able to produce R&D superior to NASA/NSF./

** Some Concluding statements

NASA has the highest R&D budget allocation towards climate change, and one that is significantly higher than all the other departments put together. The median spending on R&D towards climate change has been increasing over the years, which is a good sign considering the importance of the problem. Some further explorations could be along the lines of the percentage change in spending per department every year, and the proportion of each department in terms of percentage for each year.

** Summary

This project is an exploration of BASH scripting utilising =cURL= and =diff= to extract chat logs of an IRC channel and quickly compare the contents to check for any discrepancies. Several new concepts were learned, including defining variables, for loops, conditionals and making temporary files. The gradual build up in complexity is shown and has the benefit that that report can serve as a simple tutorial in BASH scripting.

[[file:/scripts/bash-log-compare.sh][Download the script]]

** Preliminary notes:
- The raw knob can be used to extract the text of the logs. The raw mechanism will spit out a maximum of 500 lines.
  - i.e if a user provides a large range of id's - this will have to be split into batches of 500 lines.
- W.r.t diff the focus will be on id < 1000,000.
- My initial idea to use R and connect to the db snapshot was an example of an unnecessarily bloated solution when readily available bash + curl + diff can do the job.

** Plan
1. Create a simple case:
   1. Use curl on raw knob links from each box > write this to a text file.
   2. Use diff to compare the text files.
2. Include variables to substitute start id and end id.
3. Strategy for a id range above 500
4. Enable providing arguments (url(s), startid and endid) to supply to the bash script so it can be invoked easily from the command line.

So far, so good. Now comes the /relatively/ tricky part: extending the above to cover more than 500 lines. This will need some conditionals and a for loop thrown in for dealing with a large range.

** Figuring out a larger range

Strategy:
1. Obtain a startid and endid (i.e =istart= and =iend=)
2. If (endid-startid <= 500) - go ahead with directly using curl and diff.
3. If endid-startid > 500
   1. divide the number of lines by 500. Obtain the quotient and remainder.
   2. Use the quotient in a for loop as the number of times the internal startidi is incremented by 500.
   3. the internal endidi is subtracted by 1 to account for duplication of lines.
   4. Subtract the remainder from original endid to extract the last portion.

** Concluding remarks
- a neat little bash script is constructed which will retrieve content from 2 specified URL's and diff the output. Particularly, the script was constructed to compare the #o logs on logs.ossasepia.com and logs.nosuchlabs.com
- functions, conditionals, loops, for bash were learned and deployed, along with using curl and diff.
- Retrieving a large number of lines will take some time and is also dependent on the internet speed. The curl/diff files will be empty if the lines are non-existent.
- Diff results of the logs from line 9998683 to 1000000 indicates there are no missing lines.
- the =check_output= function only checks if the files are empty. It does not account for curl retrieving error messages.
- In a batch retrieval - the final curl output is checked whether empty. It does not account for empty retrievals for a particular batch.
- overflow/underflow is not accounted for in this script.

This is a Python script for a portable, scalable job scheduler with
multiple priorities - for ANSYS CFX simulations. The script was designed
to be called every minute by an external scheduler program.

- In the practical case, the free version of the software [[https://www.splinterware.com/products/scheduler.html][System
  Scheduler]] was used to deploy the script successfully, for over 3
  years, managing 2 computing clusters.

Once called, the program basically loops through pre designated folders
and lists .def files based on the /last modified/ date available in
Windows. The system interaction is via BASH scripts created via the
Python code, as well as the python OS library. There are several
in-built flags to support priority, pausing a particular cluster,
logging data and troubleshooting.

The idea behind the project was to create a multi-platform job scheduler
for ANSYS CFX that has a balance between sophistication and ease of
deployment (and management). Typically job schedulers and load balancing
programs are relatively very sophisticated and complex to setup with
several pre-requisites and constraints. Such complexity dictates
expensive commercial support and licensing considerations.

** Problem Statement
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: problem-statement
  :END:

A job scheduler or simulation management system was required to address
the following:

- Optimum and continuous simulation solver license utilisation by all
  members of the team in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) basis,
- Provision for dynamic or urgent priority jobs, as well as an interface
  to submit simulations or view job history.
- Optimisation and management of workload of simulation jobs
  facilitating overall project management and planning.

** What the program accomplished
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: what-the-program-accomplished
  :END:

- Allowed users to submit simulations by simply placing the input files
  in a particular folder location, which also served as a particular
  priority basket.
- Removed the need of creating manual scripts to submit multiple
  simulations and resolved inefficient license utilisation approaches.
- Facilitated a optimised approach to certain design cases, thus
  resulting in a 75% reduction in simulation time
- Enabled the use of consistent solver and memory utilisation parameters
  and settings, allowing efficient deployment and reducing
  inefficiencies due to errors.
- Allowed optimal or perfect utilisation of available licensing scheme,
  resulting in a significant increase in team output and productivity.

** Motivation

During my initial foray into open source CFD and especially getting
started with Linux - there was a lot of information that I had to
collate from different sources in order to figure out each step. In
addition, there were perspectives on performance that could be gained
only through experience. Therefore, I plugged back the knowledge gained
to the CFD-Online wiki with the idea that it would help any newbie get
started a little quicker.

In the last few years, the number of courses and the material available on-line
on CFD, Linux and applying Numerical techniques has increased
substantially. This is somewhat supported by the increasing trend of page views
[[https://www.cfd-online.com/About/][shown on the CFD-Online Wiki]]. Nevertheless, this document still serves as a
useful overview and getting started guide.

The documentation explores the idea of Open Source software, and the
basic techniques to get started with the exploration. Eg: the different
options of running Linux on your current machine as well as the pros and
cons of each approach, and the software options available, as well as
links to useful and high quality information and tutorials.

*Abstract*

Combustion is the primary source of vehicular pollution. The Euro countries recently agreed on the goal that would reduce current vehicular emission , in particular carbon emissions by 85% by 2050. This would mean a 95% reduction in the carbonisation of the transportation sector, which is one of the accepted prolific contributors to pollution. As will be seen, de-carbonisation is a key issue with vehicular light duty diesel engine emissions, along with reduction in NOx, with the latter being highlighted. Two constituents of diesel emissions, Particulate Matter (PM) and NOx are contradictory in the conditions of their formation and hence require a combination of technologies to solve the problem satisfactorily. Consequently, emission reduction technologies are of extreme importance. The most stringent norms are those of Super Ultra Low Emission Vehicles (SULEV) formed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Euro 6 has been proposed and awaiting approval. The author’s opinion of a balanced solution being a combination of several technologies is established. The logical path to this conclusion is presented, duly referenced.

*Design of an Electro-mechanical Anthropometric finger, and a PID controller for the wrist for applications in Prosthetics*

*Abstract*

The design of the finger to be attached to a modular prosthetic hand and a controller solution for the wrist are explored in this effort. A novel design of a sliding body has been proposed using a Solidworks model where the outershell, providing form to the finger can be slid in or out off a of a light weight chassis and tightened with a screw. In addition to this the end effector is removabl. This provides an easy method to inspect the mechanism especially as the wiring and the motors are embedded inside.The report deals with key aspects such as the using the forward kinematics (Denavit-Hartenberg equations (DHE)) to component selection for building the model. The wrist is treated as as separate design issue and a Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller has been designed and manually tuned to control the rotation of the wrist, using Simulink. Though these continuous equations applied, are assuming ideal conditions, a saturation of the output provides realistic limits and conditions and a more realistic view of what occurs. The results obtained and the tuning process are explained and the conclusions are reached."
