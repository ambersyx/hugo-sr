I'm an **engineer**, **dreamer**, **hacker**, **data scientist** and **technophile** who enjoys performing in-depth research and analysis, as well as developing end-to-end solutions that drive Business Intelligence and Growth.

Armed with a strong background in **analytics** that started in computational physics along with a wide domain exposure - I'm constantly honing a keen eye to comprehend the big picture. I possess a penchant towards implementing workflow automation and have worked with multi-functional and multi-national teams. I've executed, as well as managed projects revolving around R&D, Analytics, Sales, ERP systems, and more.

I'm frequently available on IRC with the nickname shrysr on a bunch of channels, especially #emacs. I'm active on Linked in and Github, and occassionally on Twitter.
