* Proposed and established a proof-of-concept Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system replacing manual workflows with significantly enhanced and efficient setups.

	- The system facilitated a data centric management and overview of the end-to-end workflow including CRM, sales, purchase, manufacturing; with potentially enhanced customer engagement through an online store for the entire product line.
* Leveraged hands-on product experience to develop material codification master lists of products and inventory.
* Used `R` for an Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) process on data from an `SQL` database to the ERP system.

* Designed and optimised the hydraulic components of centrifugal water pumps developing and analyzing distributed numerical simulations of fluid flow i.e. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).
* Developed a simulation scheduler program in Python which managed 2 distributed computing clusters of 32 cores each, 24/7 for 2+ years.
	- Enabled multi-priority job submission with streamlined project and resource management.
	- Increased software capacity utilisation to 100%, saving 40min (75%) in a critical design step.

- Automated the post processing of large simulation results (~4GB) with macros that extracted functional performance snapshots (3% ~ 100MB). The approach eliminated hours of delay between assessing simulation results on remote clusters.

- Developed templates automating pipelined simulation setups that eliminated complex, repetitive manual steps.
