Completed several courses covering `python`, `git`, `SQL`,`regular expressions`. Most of these courses were completed during the occasional *Free Weekend* opportunities from [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/), where the paid courses are available to be completed at no cost, for an entire weekend."

- My [Code School Report ](https://www.codeschool.com/users/shrysr) is no longer available, since Pluralsight seem to be revamping these courses. However, these were great introductory courses.
