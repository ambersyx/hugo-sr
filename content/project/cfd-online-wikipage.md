## Motivation {#motivation}

During my initial foray into open source CFD and especially getting
started with Linux - there was a lot of information that I had to
collate from different sources in order to figure out each step. In
addition, there were perspectives on performance that could be gained
only through experience. Therefore, I plugged back the knowledge gained
to the CFD-Online wiki with the idea that it would help any newbie get
started a little quicker.

In the last few years, the number of courses and the material available on-line
on CFD, Linux and applying Numerical techniques has increased
substantially. This is somewhat supported by the increasing trend of page views
[shown on the CFD-Online Wiki](https://www.cfd-online.com/About/). Nevertheless, this document still serves as a
useful overview and getting started guide.

The documentation explores the idea of Open Source software, and the
basic techniques to get started with the exploration. Eg: the different
options of running Linux on your current machine as well as the pros and
cons of each approach, and the software options available, as well as
links to useful and high quality information and tutorials.
