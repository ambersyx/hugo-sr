# About me

I'm an **engineer**, **dreamer**, **hacker**, **data scientist** and **technophile** who enjoys performing in-depth research and analysis, as well as developing end-to-end solutions that drive Business Intelligence and Growth.

Along with a strong background in analytics and a wide domain exposure, I possess a keen eye to comprehend the big picture along with a penchant towards implementing workflow automation. I've worked in R&D, helped sales engineering and have implemented ERP systems (among other things).

My interests also extend to quantified self improvement and productivity techniques, writing, research and using [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) for all my workflows.

I'm often on IRC with the nickname shrysr on several channels.
