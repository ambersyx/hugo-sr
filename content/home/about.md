# About me

I am a post graduate mechanical engineer,  with 5+ years of work experience in several functions revolving around the areas of:

- R&D
- Design engineering, 
- Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations,
- Combustion 
- Aerodynamics. 
- Application Engineering
- Programming

I also have a keen interest in the field of Data Science, and enjoy coding and automating workflows. My interest also extends to quantified self improvement and productivity techniques, writing, research and using [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) for all my workflows.
