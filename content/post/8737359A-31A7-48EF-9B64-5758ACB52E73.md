There are way too many commands to remember in Emacs. However, a bunch of these commands will be used very repetitively to get things done. While keyboard shortcuts can be devised, it also becomes cumbersome to remember the combinations. This is where Hydras are very useful, and also provide the base for progressively evolving workflows.

An excellent example of using Hydras to speed up workflow is detailed in this blog article, which focuses on refiling headings rapidly. As the number of headings in the Org agenda files increases, it takes a longer time to compile a list of the headings.
