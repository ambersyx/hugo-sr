RStudio seems to be an impressive IDE, especially in terms of startup speed, ease of documentation access, customisation options, project management options and key-bindings that can be made close to Emacs. RStudio is certainly a good starting for a beginner.

However, the ESS package for Emacs provides an excellent platform to implement R scripts, especially in conjunction with Org mode.

The R Markdown method of introducing sections with headings / comments using the "----" with headings is quite excellent to jump to sections of code. However, this does not reach the functionality possible with Org mode and Org Babel, combined with Org Projectile and Org Capture which make it simplicity itself to capture tasks or notes specific to a project, without excessively polluting the code snippets.
