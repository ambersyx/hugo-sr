[Reference Article](http://ossasepia.com/2018/03/30/my-first-2-years-as-cto-for-minigame/trackback/)

-   Contains a reference to `chetty` ([Martha McCuller](http://trilema.com/2016/and-now-the-story-has-an-ending/)), which was inspiring to read.
    Seeing the variety in Martha's exposure felt encouraging. It led me to reflect
    that I need not hold on to a past regret of not having done something, and that I learned _something_ from each experience.
-   Diana describes that she no specific game plan to begin with, except wanting
    to play Eulora. I can empathise with this idea, but is that enough? Enough for
    what... succeeding in life? Have I defined what success means to me in any
    practically useful (non-ephemeral) way? The answer so far is still
    disturbingly vague: I've found happiness in doing work that engages my mind
    and enables me to 'discover'. I'd like my work to mean something and as of
    now, I think this translates to being useful for somebody other than myself.
-   [Interesting to note](http://ossasepia.com/2018/03/30/my-first-2-years-as-cto-for-minigame/#selection-77.1-77.421) Diana's remark that the beginning always seems to be optimistically naive despite scars accumulated over a lifetime. I won't say that my optimism in general is _not_ tempered at least a little through experience, but I think this is more related to a caution with respect to time frames of project completion, and the realization that it is not possible to be productive 24/7, like cramming before a test in school. However, I wonder if making progress is impossible without this optimism, no matter how 'misguided'.
