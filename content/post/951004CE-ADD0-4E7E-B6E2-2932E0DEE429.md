I have recently returned to my MacBook Pro as the primary driver for daily
work. While I do enjoy using Antergos / Arch Linux - at this time the
primary reason is that my macbook has an SSD, which makes things
significantly faster in all respects.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> <sup>, </sup><sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> <sup>, </sup><sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>

Before my foray into Emacs, I purchased applications like [IAWriter](https://ia.net/writer)
(classic), [Marked2](http://brettterpstra.com/2017/08/01/long-form-writing-with-marked-2-plus-2-dot-5-11-teaser/), [Texts](http://www.texts.io/) (cross platform Mac/Windows) and also tried
several other free apps for longer form writing. I am a fan of zen
writing apps, and in particular the font and environment provided by
IAWriter are quite conducive to focused writing. 

Texts has some nifty features (besides being cross platform), but the
font and appearance is not as beautiful as IAWriter. Neither IAWriter
(classic) nor Texts can be customised to the extent possible in
Emacs. See the comparison below:

{{< figure src="/img/emacs-texts.png" title="Emacs (writeroom-mode + Iosevka font) || Texts (Sepia theme)" >}}

{{< figure src="/img/emacs-iawriter.png" title="Emacs (writeroom-mode, Iosevka font) || IAWriter(Classic)" >}}

While everybody's style and approach vary, there are many authors who
swear by archaic text editors and tools, even today. I use Emacs for
everything I can today, and it's powerful interface could be termed
'archaic'.

My return to the MacBook Probook sent me down the rabbit hole of
reviewing my apps and workflows (again). After the initial struggle,
feeling the onset of being drowned in apps and reviews - I realised
that it was ridiculous to search for writing app, when Emacs could be
customised to what I needed it to be. I had forgotten the fundamental
tenet of Emacs.

Zen writing apps are called so because they have a unique combination
of fonts, background color, including line spacing and overall
text-width - all of which enable a streamlined and focused flow of
words onto the screen.

The next best thing to a retina display on a MacBook Pro, is a beautiful
font face to take you through the day, enhancing the viewing pleasure
and thus the motivation to work longer.

I have started using the [writeroom-mode](https://github.com/joostkremers/writeroom-mode) <sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup> and customising Emacs
to mimic IAWriter for all my focused writing / programming work. I
have become attached to the font [Iosevka](https://be5invis.github.io/Iosevka/) . There's still a lot of
tweaking to be done with `writeroom-mode`, but this is certainly a
workable result.

I found `Iosevka` through a comment on an [old Emacs reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/5twcka/which_font_do_you_use/) discussion,
which is worth visiting, simply to see a number of fonts that you've
probably never heard of. Regarding Iosevka, one post said *"it*
*doesn't look like much, but after a few hours it will be difficult to*
*use any other font."* This is exactly what happened to me.


# Footnotes

<sup><a id="fn.1" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> In particular, `mu4e` responds much more quickly and there is
significantly less lag in accessing emails and `HTML`
rendering. Overall, no matter how lightweight the OS is - the SSD
makes a rather magnificent difference to operational speed, breathing
life into old notebooks. Did I mention my MacBook Probook pro is a 8
years old?

<sup><a id="fn.2" href="#fnr.2">2</a></sup> Of course, the other advantages is that installation and setup
instructions are typically available out the box for the MacBook
Pro. I have access to dedicated apps including Evernote, Dash,
Spotify, Whatsap, Slack, not to mention the retina display, which
makes a massive difference to viewing pleasure.

<sup><a id="fn.3" href="#fnr.3">3</a></sup> I do love Arch Linux and Antergos. However, a little bit of
elegance in the user interface and hardware does ease up the mind. On
the MBP, out of the box - it is easy to move around virtual desktops
and use the magic track pad to rapidly switch between applications as
well. Perhaps, all of this may be setup with diligence and due time on
Linux through open source solutions of varying levels of
quality. However, as of today, I would have struggled, and quite
possibly ended up making compromises. This would be after hours of
searching for a alternate (and acceptable) solution for software
packages that are not yet ported to Linux. Typically, the compromises
would mean using Electron or Web based versions of apps, which are
often not as powerful as the desktop app.

<sup><a id="fn.4" href="#fnr.4">4</a></sup> My nascent configuration for writeroom-mode in emacs is as follows. It's remarkable how much was achieved with a few line of code!

    (with-eval-after-load 'writeroom-mode
      (define-key writeroom-mode-map (kbd "C-s-,") #'writeroom-decrease-width)
      (define-key writeroom-mode-map (kbd "C-s-.") #'writeroom-increase-width)
      (define-key writeroom-mode-map (kbd "C-s-=") #'writeroom-adjust-width))
    
    (advice-add 'text-scale-adjust :after
            #'visual-fill-column-adjust)
