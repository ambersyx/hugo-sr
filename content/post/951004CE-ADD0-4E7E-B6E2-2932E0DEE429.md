Before my foray into Emacs, I purchased applications like [IAWriter](https://ia.net/writer)
(classic)<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>, [Marked2](http://brettterpstra.com/2017/08/01/long-form-writing-with-marked-2-plus-2-dot-5-11-teaser/), [Texts](http://www.texts.io/) (cross platform Mac/Windows), and have
also tried almost all the recommended apps for longer form writing. I
am a fan of zen writing apps. In particular the font and environment
provided by IAWriter are conducive to focused writing. There also
exist apps like Hemingway that also help check the quality of your
writing.

Zen writing apps are called so because they have a unique combination
of fonts, background color, including line spacing and overall
text-width - all of which enable a streamlined and focused flow of
words onto the screen. Any customisation required towards this end is
possible in Emacs. 

The Texts app has some nifty features (besides being cross platform),
but the font and appearance is not as beautiful as IAWriter. Both
IAWriter (classic) and Texts have minimal settings for further
customisation. See the comparison below:

{{< figure src="/img/emacs-texts.png" title="Emacs (writeroom-mode + Iosevka font) || Texts (Sepia theme)" >}}

{{< figure src="/img/emacs-iawriter.png" title="Emacs (writeroom-mode, Iosevka font) || IAWriter(Classic)" >}}

While everybody's style and approach vary, there are many authors who
swear by archaic text editors and tools that enable distraction free
writing. One example is [Tony Ballantyne's post on writing tools](http://tonyballantyne.com/how-to-write/writing-tools/),
and several more examples are available in this [blog post](http://irreal.org/blog/?p=4651).

The next best thing to a clear retina display on a MacBook Pro, is a
beautiful font face to take you through the day, enhancing the viewing
pleasure and thus the motivation to work longer.

In Emacs, the [writeroom-mode](https://github.com/joostkremers/writeroom-mode) <sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> and Emacs can be customised to
mimic IAWriter. In this regard, the font [Iosevka](https://be5invis.github.io/Iosevka/), is a great font to
try. This [old Emacs reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/5twcka/which_font_do_you_use/) has many more suggestions. One post
described Iosevka as *"it* *doesn't look like much, but after a few hours
it will be difficult to* *use any other font."* This is exactly what
happened to me.


# Footnotes

<sup><a id="fn.1" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> The latest version of IAWriter has a truck load of features and
advantages over over the Classic version. I did consider purchasing
it, but Emacs won the day. Nevertheless, as a plain vanilla writing
app - IAWriter offers much right out of the box.

<sup><a id="fn.2" href="#fnr.2">2</a></sup> There's still a lot of tweaking to be done with `writeroom-mode`,
but this is certainly a workable result. My nascent configuration for
writeroom-mode in emacs is as follows (munged off the internet!). It's remarkable how much was
achieved with a few lines of code!

    (with-eval-after-load 'writeroom-mode
      (define-key writeroom-mode-map (kbd "C-s-,") #'writeroom-decrease-width)
      (define-key writeroom-mode-map (kbd "C-s-.") #'writeroom-increase-width)
      (define-key writeroom-mode-map (kbd "C-s-=") #'writeroom-adjust-width))
    
    (advice-add 'text-scale-adjust :after
            #'visual-fill-column-adjust)
