Discovered the glorious awesome lists today on Github. They are
available through a [simple search on github](https://github.com/search?utf8=%25E2%259C%2593&q=awesome+list&type=), and contain curated
lists of resources of all kinds on a multitude of topics.

As one might expect, there is a lot of common ground between these lists,
including topics and links.

How could one search for a keyword through all these repositories?  I
have always wanted search for particular keywords or code snippets in
my Emacs configuration files, or in other files in a particular
location. This is especially to verify if a bit of code or note is
already available, in another location. Something that looks like this ;):

An answer had been available in [Howard's cool blog post](http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/why-emacs.html) on why one
should learn Emacs - in a footnote (!), in which he's mentioned `ack`
and `ag` ([the silver searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher)). <sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>. It is even possible to
edit in line with each search.

The silver searcher github page provides clear examples of how it's
significantly faster than ack (and similar). Further exploration led
me to the [emacs-helm-ag](https://github.com/syohex/emacs-helm-ag) package, which is a helm interface to [the
silver searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher). Implementing emacs-helm-ag was as simple as adding it
to my list of packages, and adding a basic setup to my helm
configuration.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>

Sweet !!

# Footnotes

<sup><a id="fn.1" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> This is my first animated gif in a blog post! It was tricky! I used the free [GIPHY capture app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/giphy-capture-the-gif-maker/id668208984?mt=12) on the Mac store.

<sup><a id="fn.2" href="#fnr.2">2</a></sup> As of now, I add packages to [Scimax](https://github.com/jkitchin/scimax) using this bit of code that I've obviously borrowed from the internet, and this case - I'm afraid I did not note the source.
