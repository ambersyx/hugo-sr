Recently there was a question as to what a Binary is, building off a question [posted on the Rstudio community forum](https://community.rstudio.com/t/meaning-of-common-message-when-install-a-package-there-are-binary-versions-available-but-the-source-versions-are-later/2431). I've always found these aspects interesting, and a little hard to keep track of the connections and flow - So I've made a flowchart that will help me remember and hopefully explain what is happening to a noob.

In this process, I was able to remember [One of the first](http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Unix-and-Internet-Fundamentals-HOWTO/) documents I really enjoyed reading when I started learning how to use Linux. I would recommend that article for anybody starting out. The document is meant for people with a non-technical background, but I think it is technical enough.
